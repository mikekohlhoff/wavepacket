! nStates : number of states to run calculations for
! TEST: .TRUE. stops calculation after initial diagonalisation, use this option if you want to find the state number first!
!       .FALSE. diagonalises and the propagates the wf      
! MEANFIELD: .TRUE. for meanfield calc, .FALSE. for constant velocity calc
! MPLOT: output wavefunction for plotting? (note: output files can get big! don't just plot out wf willy nilly!)

&CONTROL
nStates = 1,
TEST = .TRUE.,
MEANFIELD = .TRUE.,
MPLOT = .FALSE.

! ni : principal quantum number of interest
! n0 : array indeces of states of interest; determined by TEST=.TRUE. above.
!      the first state for n=ni is at Sum_1^(ni-1) I think
! k0 : k-state quantum numbers of interest

&STATE
ni = 3,
n0 = 4,
k0 = -2

! field : electric field
! v0 : initial velocity of particle (at starting distance)

&ENVIRONMENT

! CWDVR parameters (the propagation grid)
! nt : no. of cwdvr angular points, can be greater than ntb if desired
! dk : coulomb wave parameter: inc. dk-> 1.more points, 2.smaller sep further out, 3.more even distribution at larger dist
! z : inc. z-> smaller the first grid point  
! initial diagonalisation grid parameters (regularised Laguerre)
! b : radial scaling parameter
! nrb : no. of radial points for initial diagonalisation
